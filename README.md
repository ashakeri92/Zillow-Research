### Overview and Business Problem

The goal of this analysis is to identify the top 5 zipcodes for our client to invest in. The team is not familiar with the Texas housing market therefore we will incororporate coefficients of variance to help filter most risk appropriate counties. The results from this analysis will provide them with the forecast of the next 10 year mean house value in the top 5 ZipCodes as well as ROI in 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years.


### Data

The dataset for this analysis was gathered from Zillow Research, and contains median home sales price in 1,293 individual ZipCodes from 2000-01-31 to 2022-08-31. Each row represents a unique ZipCode indexed with RegionID, and contains other location info as well as median housing sales price for each month.
